# Michael Antar - Personal Portfolio

This repo contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It's a fully responsive, SPA designed to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects. I was inspired by Apple's recent _glassmorphism_ design, and used an interactive bubble background that works well for both light and dark modes.
